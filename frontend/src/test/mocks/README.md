# Test Mocks

This directory contains mock data and helpers used in frontend tests.

- `account.ts` provides a sample `AccountData` object for login scenarios.

Add new files for additional mocks or helpers. Keep mocks small and focused on a single concern, and update this document when new mocks are introduced or existing ones change.

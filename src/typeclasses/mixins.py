class ObjectParent:
    """
    This is a mixin that can be used to override *all* entities inheriting at
    some distance from DefaultObject (Objects, Exits, Characters and Rooms).

    Just add any method that exists on `DefaultObject` to this class. If one
    of the derived classes has itself defined that same hook already, that will
    take precedence.

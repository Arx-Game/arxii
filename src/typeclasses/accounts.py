Account

The Account represents the game "account" and each login has only one
Account object. An Account is what chats on default channels but has no
other in-game-world existence. Rather the Account puppets Objects (such
as Characters) in order to actually participate in the game world.


Guest

Guest accounts are simple low-level accounts that are created/deleted
on the fly and allows users to test the game without the commitment
of a full registration. Guest accounts are deactivated by default; to
activate them, add the following line to your settings file:

    GUEST_ENABLED = True

You will also need to modify the connection screen to reflect the
possibility to connect with a guest account. The setting file accepts
several more options for customizing the Guest account system.

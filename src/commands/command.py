    Base command we'll use for all Arx II commands. We'll take a different approach
    than Evennia. Evennia has very 'fat' commands that contain all the business logic
    for any given action a player wishes to take. By contrast, we want our commands
    to be very thin - the only thing a command should be responsible for is to try to
    help determine what a player is attempting to do and to what, fetch whatever object
    the player is targeting if they can, then call whatever method or service function
    is appropriate for processing that action. We'll catch any exception raised by the
    process of trying to obtain a target or calling the method, and if so, report that
    message to the player. That is it. All logic should happen elsewhere: the command
    is purely a view/UI layer.

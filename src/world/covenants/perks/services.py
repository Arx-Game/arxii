"""Perk resolution service for per-vow situational perks (#2536, Task 3).

``applicable_perks`` decides WHICH perks fire for one acting character's
resolution (a cast or a check) — the piece every seam (Tasks 4-6: the
``POWER_BONUS``/``CHECK_BONUS`` providers, the announce path) calls into.
Nothing in this module writes; it is a pure read that returns the fired set
for the caller to apply.

## What counts as a covenant-mate

Two different modules answer "who is a covenant-mate" for two different
questions, deliberately differently:

- **Group membership for perk beneficiaries** (this module's
  ``applicable_perks``, and ``evaluators.ally_low_health``, which this module
  matches on purpose): a covenant-mate is a character who BOTH (a) holds an
  ENGAGED role (``CharacterCovenantRole.engaged``) in a covenant the acting
  character is also actively engaged in, AND (b) is physically grouped with
  the acting character for this resolution — the same combat encounter's
  active roster in combat, the same active Scene otherwise (see
  ``_group_sheet_ids``). Perks are a benefit of ACTIVE, PRESENT vows: an
  unengaged member is "in civilian garb" (does not extend or receive
  group-beneficiary perks even though ``Character.shares_covenant_with``
  would still say they share a covenant), and an engaged member who isn't
  here right now cannot lend their vow to a fight or a negotiation they are
  not part of.
- **Provenance situations** (``evaluators.target_swayed_by_ally``)
  legitimately read HISTORY instead of live group membership: who applied a
  condition is a past fact about the moment it landed, not a claim about
  right-now presence or engagement. The applier's current engagement state
  does not retroactively un-charm the target — a covenant-mate who has since
  disengaged their vow (or wandered off to another scene) still "swayed for
  the team" for a condition they already applied. ``target_swayed_by_ally``
  therefore uses ``Character.shares_covenant_with`` (ACTIVE membership only,
  no engagement or co-presence requirement), not the rule above.

Both halves are deliberate — see the one-line cross-reference comment at
``evaluators.target_swayed_by_ally``.

## Beneficiary evaluation point (spec §2)

Perks are evaluated at the ACTING character's (the ``subject``'s) resolution
moment, never on the perk-holder's own timer. The candidate set is:

- ``SELF``/``WHOLE_GROUP`` perks on the subject's own engaged roles (anchor
  AND resolved sub-role both apply — sub-role perks ADD, never replace).
- ``COVENANT_ALLIES``/``WHOLE_GROUP`` perks on an engaged covenant-mate's
  (see above) engaged role — anchor AND the mate's own resolved sub-role
  both apply, same ADD semantics as the subject's own roles (a mate's
  level-3+ sub-role vow perk must be able to fire for the group, not just
  their base vow — see ``_ally_sub_role_candidates``).

``COVENANT_ALLIES`` never fires for the holder's own action because the
subject is structurally excluded from being counted as their own covenant-
mate; ``WHOLE_GROUP`` fires for both cases (the holder's own action via the
first bullet, a mate's action via the second) — "includes the holder."

## Query discipline

Every step below is a small, FIXED number of queries independent of how many
perks/situations/rungs/mates are authored: one query for the subject's own
active memberships (cached per-character by the covenant-roles handler), a
bounded number of resolve calls for the subject's own engaged roles (scales
with the subject's OWN role count, not perk count), one query for the
co-presence roster, one query for the batched ally ``CharacterCovenantRole``
fetch (with ``select_related("covenant_role")`` so the anchor role rides the
same query — no per-mate follow-up), one query for the batched ally
COVENANT_ROLE ``Thread`` fetch across every mate at once (see
``_ally_sub_role_candidates``), a bounded number of ``CovenantRole
.matching_variant`` resolve calls — one per DISTINCT anchor role held among
the group's mates (SharedMemoryModel's identity map de-dupes mates sharing
the same role to one Python instance, so this scales with role DIVERSITY in
the group, never with mate COUNT), and ONE query (plus 2 prefetch queries —
``situations``, ``rungs``, only issued when at least one candidate perk
matches) for the candidate-perk fetch regardless of how many perks match.
The candidate-perk fetch group is fixed at UP TO 3 queries (base + 2
prefetches) in every shape; the documented CEILING for the full
``applicable_perks`` pipeline in the worst common shape (allies present, a
matching perk, one shared anchor role among the mates) is **6** — see
``test_perk_resolution.PerkResolutionQueryBudgetTests`` (perk-count
invariance, self-only shape, ceiling 3) and
``test_perk_resolution.AllyMateCountQueryBudgetTests`` (mate-count
invariance, 2 vs 5 mates on one shared role, ceiling 6).

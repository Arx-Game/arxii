"""Service functions for the unified NPC service framework.

- ``persona_for_character`` resolves a PC's primary persona — used by the
  HTTP wiring (start_interaction) to compute persona from the request's
  puppeted character.
- ``start_interaction`` / ``available_offers`` / ``resolve_offer`` /
  ``end_interaction`` make up the in-memory interaction state machine.
  State is ephemeral — lives in the dataclass instance for the duration
  of one interaction and is never persisted. Durable side effects:
  ``NPCStanding`` affection on close, ``OfferCooldown`` row on final
  grants whose offer carries a non-null cooldown, the effect handler's
  downstream object on each grant.

Standing (affection) and cooldown are deliberately orthogonal — cooldown
lives on :class:`OfferCooldown` (per-(offer, persona)) so it works for
every offer kind, not only NPC-rooted ones.

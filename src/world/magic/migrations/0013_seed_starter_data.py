NOTE: This migration previously contained seed data for TechniqueStyle,
EffectType, Restriction, and ResonanceAssociation.

Seed data was removed per CLAUDE.md fixtures policy. This data should be
managed via fixtures (gitignored) or Django admin, not migrations.

The migration file is kept as a no-op to preserve migration history.

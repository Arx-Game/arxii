"""Mission resolution engine (Phase 3) — pure service functions.

This module is the runtime that walks a :class:`MissionInstance` through its
authored graph. It owns NO new check/consequence math: it reuses
``world.checks.perform_check`` for the dice and
``world.checks.consequence_resolution.apply_resolution`` for the effects,
mirroring ``world.mechanics.challenge_resolution`` (notably its
``_select_consequence`` synthetic-fallback pattern).

Phase 3 is SINGLE-participant: ``viewer``/``actor`` is the one acting
participant. Multi-participant union/arbitration is Phase 4.

Design invariants honored here:
  * difficulty for every CHECK is ``instance.template.risk_tier`` (the only
    authored DC); ``base_risk`` is the surfaced "Risk" axis, never the DC.
  * a route's authored ``consequence`` is applied when set; otherwise a
    synthetic UNSAVED fallback ``Consequence`` is built so
    ``apply_resolution`` is still called uniformly (and returns [] for the
    unsaved row — mirrors ``challenge_resolution._select_consequence``).
  * riders compose ADDITIVELY (a second ``apply_resolution`` call), never by
    precedence, and only when the node permits them.
  * M1: never trust a possibly-stale cached ``instance.current_node``; engine
    functions operate on the ``node`` argument and write (not read) the FK.
  * Phase 5b.0: TERMINAL routes (next_node is None) emit
    :class:`MissionDeedRewardLine` rows from
    :class:`MissionOptionRouteReward` templates on the route via
    :func:`emit_terminal_rewards`. Non-terminal routes still emit no
    reward lines; a terminal route with no authored reward templates
    likewise emits zero lines (returns an empty list).

Roster selector functions for character application filtering.

This module will contain selector functions that filter available characters
based on player trust levels and roster policies when the trust system is
implemented.

## Planned Functionality

### Character Visibility and Application Eligibility

The trust system will evaluate players on multiple dimensions:

1. **IC Conflict Handling Trust**
   - Ability to make conflicts fun and engaging for all parties
   - Track record of graceful conflict resolution
   - Skill at separating IC and OOC concerns

2. **Character Performance Trust**
   - Consistency in character portrayal and development
   - Engagement with storylines and other players
   - Reliability in maintaining character activity

3. **Story Responsibility Trust**
   - Experience managing plot threads and story beats
   - Ability to share spotlight and create opportunities for others
   - Track record with character influence and power

### Planned Selector Functions

```python
def get_visible_roster_entries_for_player(player_data, roster_queryset=None):
    '''
    Filter roster entries based on player trust levels and character requirements.

    Will consider:
    - Player's trust level in various categories
    - Character-specific trust requirements (Noble houses, military leaders, etc.)
    - Current character load and story commitments
    - Application cooldowns and restrictions
    - Staff approval requirements for restricted characters
    '''

def get_roster_counts_for_player(player_data):
    '''
    Return counts of available characters by roster type for UI display.
    Respects same filtering rules as get_visible_roster_entries_for_player.
    '''

def get_available_rosters_for_player(player_data):
    '''
    Return rosters that contain characters the player can apply for.
    Used for navigation and roster browsing.
    '''
```

### Trust Evaluation Framework

```python
class TrustEvaluator:
    '''
    Comprehensive trust evaluation for character applications.

    Will evaluate:
    - Historical performance with similar character types
    - Current story load and character commitments
    - Specific requirements for the requested character
    - Community feedback and GM assessments
    - Automated metrics from gameplay patterns

    Returns structured evaluation including:
    - Eligibility determination
    - Trust level assessment
    - Required approvals and review processes
    - Potential concerns or red flags
    - Auto-approval vs manual review classification
    '''
```

## Implementation Notes

- Trust evaluation should be **granular** - players may be trusted for some
  character types but not others
- System should be **transparent** - players should understand why they can
  or cannot apply for specific characters
- Evaluation should consider **story context** - some characters may be
  temporarily restricted due to active plotlines
- **Appeals process** needed for trust evaluation disputes
- **Trust building** pathways for new players to earn access to restricted characters

## Current Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

All selector functions are placeholders. Current roster system allows all
players to see and apply for any active character. Trust-based filtering
will be implemented when the player trust system is designed and built.

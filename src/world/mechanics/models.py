Mechanics System Models

Game engine mechanics for the modifier system, roll resolution, and other
mechanical calculations. This app provides the core infrastructure for
how modifiers from various sources (distinctions, magic, equipment, conditions)
are collected, stacked, and applied to checks and other game mechanics.

Models to be added:
- ModifierCategory: Groupings for modifier types (e.g., passive, active, situational)
- ModifierType: Specific modifier definitions (e.g., bonus, penalty, advantage)
- CharacterModifier: Active modifiers on a character from various sources

# Player Capability & Identity Ledger

**Status:** the single source of truth for *"what can a player do and be — and is it
releasable?"* across magic, combat, identity, and progression. Domain docs
([`combat.md`](combat.md), [`magic.md`](magic.md),
[`character-progression.md`](character-progression.md), [`species.md`](species.md))
carry the detail and link up here; planned-but-unbuilt systems live in
[`planned-systems.md`](planned-systems.md).

This ledger was rebuilt from a **code-and-test verification pass (2026-06-27)**, not from
prior roadmap prose. Where it and a domain doc disagree, **this ledger and the code win**.

## The governing tenets (read first)

1. **No improvised mechanics (the MVP bar).** Anything a player should *plausibly* be able to
   do — or any event that can plausibly happen (a war, a charm, a summons) — must have a
   **real system** to resolve it. A GM forced to wing it for an uncovered capability is a
   disaster: it puts canonical veracity and fairness in question and forces retcons. The bar
   is **coverage of plausible intent**, not exhaustive handling of rare permutations.
2. **Dazzling combinations are the product.** The point is a *dazzling number of combinations*
   across identity axes (species/lineage × gift × path × resonance × distinction × covenant
   role) so players feel special in what they can **do** and **be**. The combinatorial space is
   the product, not a nice-to-have. Realized by the one specialization engine (ADR-0055).
3. **Closed-issue ≠ proven.** A capability is "done" only when an **end-to-end test
   demonstrates the expected outcome**. "Someone merged it" and "the roadmap says SHIPPED" are
   not evidence. (This audit found the combat roadmap citing a proof file —
   `test_e2e_combat_magic_api.py` — that does not exist.)

## Tier legend

| Tier | Meaning | Treat as |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ **PROVEN** | An E2E/journey test drives the path and asserts the outcome | Done |
| 🟨 **WIRED-UNPROVEN** | Real code path exists end-to-end, but no test asserts the outcome | **Not done** — "write the journey test + fix what it exposes" is work |
| 🟧 **BUILT-NOT-WIRED** | Service/model exists but no player surface reaches it | Not done — wire it (after checking it isn't a duplicate) |
| 🟡 **SUBSTRATE** | Primitives/fields exist; the player-experienced capability isn't assembled | Not done — assemble it |
| ❌ **ABSENT** | grep + read confirm no code | Greenfield |

A row may be ❌/🟡 **and** carry **→ DESIGNED (ADR-xxxx)**: the design decision exists (an ADR),
the build does not. Those are *build-to-the-ADR* work, **not** open design questions.

The **MVP?** column is a *proposal* for your ranking. `MVP` = needed for a releasable character
system; `now` = `priority:now` keystone; `MVP+ADR` = MVP and reverses a recorded decision; `soon` =
MVP-or-immediately-after; `P2` = Phase 2 (recorded, not launch), **no-improv-flagged** the moment an
in-fiction trigger is plausible.

## Pillar BE — Identity (who you are)

| Capability | Tier | Evidence / home | MVP? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Species as **stat-bonuses** + name hierarchy | ✅ PROVEN | `world/species/models.py` | done |
| **Distinctions** (effects→modifiers, can grant *rituals*) | ✅ PROVEN | `world/distinctions/models.py` | done |
| Paths (models, next-options, path-intent) | ✅ PROVEN | `world/classes`, `world/progression` | done |
| Species **abilities/traits** beyond stats | ✅ PROVEN (infrastructure) | **ADR-0050** + **#1580**: `SpeciesGiftGrant` + `provision_species_gifts` + GIFT anchor cap (`path_stage × 10`) + RESISTANCE pull-effect; E2E `test_species_gift_e2e.py`. Pending: seed real species Minor Gift data. | now |
| **khati / vampire / lycan**, lineage / bloodline | 🟡 SUBSTRATE | **ADR-0050** + **#1580** (plumbing built — `SpeciesGiftGrant` + `provision_species_gifts`); no species → Minor Gift data rows seeded yet | now |
| Species / lineage / distinction **grants a gift** | ✅ PROVEN | **ADR-0050** + **#1580**: `SpeciesGiftGrant` through-model + `provision_species_gifts` mints `CharacterGift` + latent GIFT thread; E2E `test_species_gift_e2e.py` | now |
| Species **vulnerabilities** (vampire↔sunlight) + immunity framework | 🟡 SUBSTRATE | **#1580**: minimum substrate built — `EffectKind.RESISTANCE` + `ConditionResistanceModifier` net at `apply_damage_to_participant` (ADR-0062); broad framework + environmental triggers → **#1588** | MVP |
| Resonance as an identity axis that *differs* your magic | ❌ → DESIGNED | **ADR-0052/0055** (gift affinity + technique form from resonance) | MVP |

| **Negotiate / parley** an NPC down | ✅ PROVEN | `apply_social_disposition_delta` → `adjust_npc_affection`; durable + ephemeral tiers (#1591, ADR-0058) | MVP |
| **Effect palette**: summon, reflect, incorporeal, sink, telekinesis, teleport, obstacle, force-field | ✅ PROVEN | `effect_palette_content.py`; 9 seeded effects; summon E2E `integration_tests/pipeline/test_effect_summon_telnet_e2e.py`; reactive interceptor E2Es `integration_tests/pipeline/test_effect_reactive_families.py` (#1584) | done |
| **Companions / pets / summons** w/ breath weapons & ordered abilities | ✅ PROVEN (basic) | ALLY `CombatOpponent` via `allegiance`/`summoned_by`; opponent-vs-opponent damage; advanced ordered abilities are a follow-up | done (ADR-0059; #672 folds in) |
| **Roles grant techniques** (resonance-spec at lvl 3) | ✅ PROVEN | **ADR-0055** (the specialization engine); `CovenantRole` inherits `AbstractSpecializedVariant` + `fire_variant_discoveries` generalizes the discovery beat across `target_kind`; proven by `covenants/tests/integration/test_resonance_subrole_flow.py` (covenant) + `magic/tests/integration/test_gift_specialization_e2e.py` (gift) | done |

## Pillar GROW — Acquisition & progression (how you get stronger)

| Capability | Tier | Evidence / home | MVP? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author your **own** new techniques | ✅ PROVEN | `author_technique` | done |
| Gain a **new Gift** in play (post-CG) | 🟨 PARTIAL | **Path-crossing grant ✅ PROVEN** — crossing into a new Path mints its Gift(s) via `PathGiftGrant` + `grant_path_magic` (#1579, `test_path_crossing_grant_e2e.py`). Weave/XP-buy acquisition of a standalone Minor Gift (**ADR-0050** + **ADR-0053**) is still → #1587. | MVP |
| Grow stronger in a gift (more/stronger techniques) | ❌ → DESIGNED | **ADR-0051** (gift-thread strength, costliest kind) | MVP |
| **Learn / train / buy** an existing technique | ❌ → DESIGNED | **ADR-0056** (signature thread for one technique) + **ADR-0053** (unlock gate) | MVP |
| **Leveling grants magical power** (unlocks gifts/techniques) | 🟨 PARTIAL | **Path-crossing grant ✅ PROVEN** — advancing into a new Path (the `cross_threshold` ceremony) grants that Path's Gift + a curated starter technique set per (Path × Gift) (#1579, ADR-0055 grant leg; `test_path_crossing_grant_e2e.py`). The within-tier **gift-thread strength** axis (**ADR-0051**, more/stronger techniques by imbuing) is still → #1581. | **now (foundational)** |
| Trainer / teaching system | ❌ ABSENT | (`MentorBond` is a combat bond, not teaching) | soon |
| Path-crossing (Audere Majora) — change path in play | ✅ PROVEN | offer created by cast hook `maybe_create_audere_majora_offer` (`world/magic/services/techniques.py` Step 8c); journey driven E2E in `test_audere_telnet_e2e.py` | done |
| Ritual of the Durance level-up | 🟨 WIRED-UNPROVEN | works via generic machinery but **unseeded** | fix |
| Codex teaching / learning | 🟧 BUILT-NOT-WIRED | `CodexTeachingOffer.accept` has no player surface | soon |

## Pillar COMBINE — the specialization engine (how your axes make you singular)

| Capability | Tier | Evidence / home | MVP? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Covenant role resolution `(role × resonance × thread level)` → sub-role | ✅ PROVEN | `resolve_effective_role`; the **template** to generalize | done |
| **One specialization primitive** `(entity × resonance) → customized capability` | ✅ PROVEN | **ADR-0055** — `AbstractSpecializedVariant` base + `resolve_specialized_variant(entity, character)` (the one resolver; `resolve_effective_role` is a shim); `test_gift_specialization_e2e.py` | done |
| **Gift × Path → specialized techniques** | ✅ PROVEN | **ADR-0055** — the (Gift × Path) leg sets the *base technique set*: `PathGiftGrant` + `grant_path_magic` mint a path-specific curated set from a shared Gift on crossing (#1579, `test_path_crossing_grant_e2e.py`); resonance then specializes each on read via `TechniqueVariant` (#1578, `test_gift_specialization_e2e.py`) | done |
| **Resonance differentiates your magic** (gift affinity + technique form) | ✅ PROVEN | **ADR-0052** (gift affinity = thread resonance) + **ADR-0055** (derive-on-read); `gift_resonances_for` feeds the four cast sites; `test_gift_specialization_e2e.py` | done |
| **Signature technique** (one technique deepened, own resonance, may diverge) | ❌ → DESIGNED | **ADR-0056** (re-scope `TargetKind.TECHNIQUE`) | soon |
| **Fall / Redemption** resonance conversion (asymmetric) | ❌ → DESIGNED | **ADR-0054** (new conversion service; respect monotonic `lifetime_earned`) | soon |
| **Covenant of the Court** lets a peerless puissant hold a role | ❌ → DESIGNED | **ADR-0057** (new `CovenantType.COURT`, reuses covenant substrate) | soon |
| Multi-PC group combos `(effect-type × resonance)` | ✅ PROVEN | `ComboDefinition`/`ComboSlot` (group, not personal) | done |

## MVP work slate (derived from the tiers above)

A large build program; this ledger makes it **sequenceable and honest**. Five flavors:

### `priority:now` keystones (everything else stacks on these)
- **Major/Minor gifts** (ADR-0050) — the gift taxonomy. *Nothing else in the gift/resonance economy can be built until this exists* (species abilities, gift acquisition, gift-thread strength all depend on it).
- **The specialization primitive** (ADR-0055) — generalize `resolve_effective_role` into the one `(entity × resonance) → capability` engine. The COMBINE pillar and "roles grant techniques" depend on it.
- **Level → power coupling** (ADR-0053 + 0051) — leveling/XP must unlock gifts/techniques (today: nothing).

### Build-new (ABSENT / substrate — build to the ADR, or greenfield)
- **Identity (ADR-0050):** species abilities / lineage / khati / vampire / lycan as Minor Gifts — the infrastructure is built (#1580: `SpeciesGiftGrant` + `provision_species_gifts` + RESISTANCE substrate); pending: seed real species Minor Gift data. Broad immunity/vulnerability framework + environmental triggers → #1588 (ADR-0062).
- **Gift/resonance economy (ADR-0050–0056):** Minor-Gift acquisition; GIFT thread anchor + per-target-kind cost (0051); gift-resonance-from-thread refactor (0052); the specialization engine (0055); signature re-scope of `TargetKind.TECHNIQUE` (0056); fall/redemption conversion service (0054).
- **Covenants:** `CovenantType.COURT` + Court roles (ADR-0057).
- **Effects:** the effect palette — **SHIPPED #1584** (9 effects: summon/reflect [Mirror Ward]/
  incorporeal [Ghostform]/sink [Earthmeld]/telekinesis [Force Grip]/teleport [Phase Jump]/
  obstacle [Barricade]/force-field [Aegis Field]/blink [Phase Step]; allegiance-aware summon
  proven E2E; reactive interceptor trio proven E2E; ADR-0059 + ADR-0060). Remaining effects work:
  charm/switch-sides (#1590, allegiance-flip); NPC negotiation (#1591); condition removal/dispel.
  Teleport/obstacle/telekinesis have placeholder position IDs — runtime destination selection
  deferred to a follow-up issue.
- **Combat systems:** war/battle system; mounts & flying (P2, no-improv-flagged); ranged/archery enforcement.

### Prove-it (WIRED-UNPROVEN — write the journey E2E, fix what it exposes)
- Enemy-NPC condition application · combo full journey · thread-pull final outcome.

### Fix (integrity / foundational holes)
- `CharacterGiftViewSet` unguarded `ModelViewSet` (mints gift bindings, bypasses `action.run`).
- Audere Majora: verify the private DB seed of `AudereMajoraThreshold` rows
  (boundary levels 5/10/15/20) exists in the live DB. The offer-creation cast
  hook (`techniques.py:950`) is wired and E2E-tested, but the gate returns
  `None` at gate 2 unless those threshold rows are present. Ceremony text
  (`vision_text`/`manifestation_text`) is intentionally DB-authored only, never
  committed (see `world/magic/CLAUDE.md`, Audere & Audere Majora). No code
  change; an ops/seed-verification check.
- Ritual of the Durance unseeded.

### Cut (sludge — close, per "no rare permutations")
- #1297 (unreachable hardening), #1549 (gang-finish edge), #1213 (jargon reconciliation), #1363 (re-frame as the resonance-aware-checks design question — now COMBINE work, not a standalone ticket).

# Crafting, Fashion & Economy

**Status:** in-progress
**Depends on:** Items & Equipment, Magic (resonance/facets), Societies, Areas

## Overview
A rich economic layer that encompasses crafting, fashion, player housing, businesses, and domain management. Crafting was extremely popular in Arx 1 and will be central to Arx II. The fashion-to-resonance feedback loop is unique: assembling a wardrobe that complements your magical motif literally makes you more powerful.

## Key Design Points
- **Crafting as hobby, not class:** Crafting is separate from Path identity. Paths represent a character's adventurer calling; crafts are hobbies or side professions. Avoids overlap with combat roles
- **Material acquisition:** Through world interaction (harvesting gameplay loops), economy (buying), mission rewards, and other sources
- **Recipes:** Discovered, learned, or purchased. Gated by crafting skill levels
- **Fashion-resonance loop:** Items have facets that map to character resonances. A character with a spider facet mapped to their predatory nature gets Praedari resonance bonuses. Assembling a wardrobe that's admired by others creates a feedback loop — social perception feeds magical power
- **Player housing:** Players buy/build rooms, decorate them (decorations give room statistics), run stores and businesses from them
- **Holdings:** Large-scale constructions with defensive stats, research labs, room-specific bonuses
- **Businesses and stores:** Player-run economic entities
- **Ships:** Ownable, upgradeable vessels (e.g., a pirate ship that gets equipped, crewed, and taken on missions)
- **Noble domains:** Territories with material generation, exports/imports, economic management
- **Game economy:** Materials, trade, imports/exports — largely player-driven through crafting and domain interaction
- **Economic progression:** Owning and developing assets is another progression axis alongside XP and Path steps

## What Exists

### Generic crafting framework + enchantment/attach economy (Spec D PR2 — #1031) — DONE

The enchant-and-attach flow for facets and styles is fully playable end-to-end.

**What was built:**

- **`CraftingRecipe` framework** (`world.items.crafting`). The old `FacetCraftingConfig`
  singleton was replaced by data-driven per-kind `CraftingRecipe` rows carrying check config,
  AP/anima costs, a default consumption policy, and three related sub-models:
  `CraftingMaterialRequirement` (ingredient requirements), `CraftingSkillCap` (skill-rank →
  quality ceiling ladder), and `CraftingRecipeConsequence` (weighted consequence pool with
  per-row `CostConsumption` override).

- **Handler registry** (`CraftingHandler` ABC + `FacetAttachHandler` / `StyleAttachHandler`).
  New kinds (alchemy, wand-crafting, etc.) plug in by authoring a `CraftingRecipe` row +
  registering a thin handler — no schema change required.

- **Transactional orchestrator** `run_crafting_recipe` (`world.items.crafting.services`).
  Eight-step atomic pipeline: recipe resolve → pre-validate (no wasted rolls) →
  affordability gate → check roll → graded consequence selection → cost consumption per
  consequence policy → consequence effect application → skill-capped quality tier + attach.

- **Graded cost consumption** (`CostConsumption`: NONE / PARTIAL / FULL). Each consequence
  row in the recipe pool declares how ingredients are consumed if that consequence fires.
  PARTIAL spends `ceil(cost × 0.5)` of AP/Anima but all materials in full.

- **Skill-gated quality cap** (`CraftingSkillCap` + `resolve_capped_tier`). The crafter's
  skill rank gates the maximum quality tier regardless of how well the check rolls.

- **Multi-vector cost** (`stage_and_assert_affordable` + `consume_cost`). AP, Anima, and
  material items are all valid cost vectors; affordability is checked atomically before the
  roll so a failing check never silently deducts resources.

- **Shared material helper** (`world.items.services.materials`). `gather_consumable_pks` /
  `consume_pks` are reused by both the crafting cost path and the ritual path
  (`PerformRitualAction`) — no parallel implementation.

- **Domain wrappers** `craft_attach_facet` / `craft_attach_style`
  (`world.items.services.crafting`). Thin consumers of `run_crafting_recipe` that map
  `CraftRunResult` onto the domain-specific `FacetCraftResult` / `StyleCraftResult`.

- **Read-only crafting quote** (`build_crafting_quote`). Returns a `CraftingQuote`
  (costs, affordability, skill-capped max tier, failure risk) with no mutation;
  exposed as `GET /api/items/item-facets/quote/` and `GET /api/items/item-styles/quote/`.

- **Seeded by** `wire_enchanting_crafting()` (FactoryBoy chain doubling as integration-test
  setUp and seed data): Enchanting skill trait + CheckType + FACET_ATTACH + STYLE_ATTACH
  recipes + a cap ladder + a consequence pool.

**Deferred to follow-up issues:**
- Crafting-station durability and repair economy (#1234)
- Item-creation pipeline (crafted items with stats, facets, fashion properties) — still future
- Telnet crafting action

## What's Needed for MVP
- Material/resource models — types, sources, quantities, storage
- Item creation pipeline — crafted items with stats, facets, and fashion properties
- Fashion system — how worn item facets map to resonances, admiration mechanics (outfit
  trickle is live; admiration mechanics remain future)
- Player housing — room purchase/construction, decoration system, room stats from decor
- Store/business system — player-run shops, inventory management, pricing
- Holdings — large constructions with defensive stats, research labs, special bonuses
- Ship system — vessel models, upgrades, crew, integration with missions
- Domain management — noble territory models, material generation, imports/exports
- Trade system — player-to-player and NPC trade mechanics
- Economy balancing — currency flow, material scarcity, price stabilization
- Economy UI — shop management, domain overview, housing decoration

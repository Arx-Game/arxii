# GM System

**Status:** in-progress (Phase 1 backend complete)
**Depends on:** Staff Inbox & Player Submissions (prerequisite), Stories, Roster, Scenes

## Overview
The infrastructure for player GMs to run stories, manage tables of PCs, create roster characters, grant rewards, and progress through a trust-based level system. Staff coordinates the overall game with unrestricted tooling; GMs operate within level-appropriate caps.

## Key Design Points

### GM Identity
- **GMCharacter typeclass** — in-game object that can occupy rooms and interact with PCs. No vitals, not attackable, not a combat target, configurable approachability (who can start conversations). Puppetable by the GM's account.
- **StaffCharacter typeclass** — separate typeclass for staff (not a subclass of GM). Similar "can't be attacked" immunity but exists to host custom staff tooling commands (replacing Django admin workflows for most operations). Orthogonal to GM storytelling behavior.
- **NPCs are not the parent class** — regular NPCs have vitals and are attackable. GM/Staff characters are exceptions to that default, not extensions of it.

### GM Levels (five tiers + staff)
1. **Starting GM** — minimum approved, very limited scope and rewards
2. **Junior GM** — small scope, some independence
3. **GM** — normal operational level
4. **Experienced GM** — broader scope, world-impact stories allowed
5. **Senior GM** — near-staff privileges, can mentor others
6. **Staff** — above all levels, unrestricted

Progression is driven by player feedback/upvotes tied to stories run and how players received them — an upvote system tangentially related to kudos. Exact progression curves and reward caps are late design; early implementation just has the level enum and permission hooks.

### GM Applications
- Players apply to become GMs (motivations, experience, availability)
- Applications are their own model in the `gm` app; they show up in the **staff inbox** alongside other submission types for triage
- Staff approves/denies from the shared jobs hub
- On approval: account gains a GMProfile, GM commands unlocked, abbreviated CG flow creates their GMCharacter

### GM Tables
- A **GMTable** is a container linking one GM to a set of PCs and active stories
- Table membership: PCs are assigned (primary GM responsibility), one GM owns
- PCs can participate in stories run by other GMs (storyline relationship, not table relationship)
- Lifecycle: create, rename, archive
- **Ownership transfer** — staff can reassign a table when a GM quits or idles out
- **Surrender** — a GM can voluntarily give up a story or a table
- **Idle detection** — track GM activity; staff tooling to reassign idle tables

### Roster Character Creation (GM-owned)
- GMs create new roster characters scoped to their table (gated by level)
- Created characters go through the normal roster application flow
- GM approves/denies applications to their table's roster (via their own job queue)
- **Invite codes** — GM sends an out-of-game invite code (email); new player signs up and can claim the character during registration. Crucial for recruitment — brings in players who aren't on the game at all.

### Stories (GM's role only — stories app owns itself)
The stories app is separate and large. From the GM system's perspective, we only care about GM roles and permissions on stories:
- **Primary GM** — responsible for a PC's main storyline
- **Story author** — created and owns a story
- **Story advancer** — permission to create beats/advance a story
- **Story participant** — can run sessions for but does not own

The GM system defines these role relationships; the stories app uses them for permission checks when a GM tries to create beats, schedule sessions, or resolve tasks.

### Rewards and Gating
- GMs can grant XP, items, codex entries, legend
- All capped by GM level (exact caps are late design)
- Every grant is audit-logged (who gave what to whom, when, why, which story)
- Anti-abuse tracking: per-GM/per-week caps, unusual patterns flagged to staff
- Rewards tie into existing XP/codex/kudos systems, not a new reward pipeline

### Trust and Feedback
- **Stub data model early** — just record upvotes and feedback entries
- Player feedback on stories feeds trust
- Trust feeds GM level progression
- **Progression math is late design** — the curves, thresholds, decay rates all come later
- Tangentially related to kudos system

### Staff Character and Staff Tooling
- Staff has commands to edit world state, manage GMs, override any system
- Prefer custom tooling over Django admin for day-to-day operations
- Staff character hosts these commands; Django admin is a fallback

## What Exists
- **`world.gm` app** — GMProfile, GMApplication models with factories, admin, ViewSet, filters, serializers
- **`typeclasses.gm_characters`** — GMCharacter and StaffCharacter typeclasses (combat immune, fun rejection messages)
- **Staff inbox integration** — GMApplication appears as a triage category alongside other submission types
- **Prerequisites in place:** Roster system, Stories app (partial), Scenes, Covenants (role mechanics + Thread anchor; covenant-entity lifecycle still post-MVP — see `covenants.md`), Combat (for GM combat tools)

## What's Needed for MVP

### Phase 0 (prerequisite) — Staff Inbox & Player Submissions
- See `staff-inbox.md` for the full design
- New `player_submissions` app with `PlayerFeedback`, `BugReport`, `PlayerReport` (stub) models
- Staff inbox aggregator that reads from those + existing `RosterApplication`
- Identity summary helper on Persona for staff context
- Account history page (staff-only)
- **PlayerReport is safety-critical** — the model and submission path exist before GM onboarding, even though the full UX design comes later

### Phase 1 — GM Identity Foundation ✅
- ✅ `GMCharacter` typeclass (extends Character, combat/targeting immune, fun rejection messages)
- ✅ `StaffCharacter` typeclass (orthogonal, same immunity, hosts future staff commands)
- ✅ `GMProfile` model (OneToOne account, level, approval tracking)
- ✅ `GMApplication` model (freeform text, staff response, staff inbox integration)
- ✅ GM level TextChoices (STARTING/JUNIOR/GM/EXPERIENCED/SENIOR)
- ✅ GMApplication ViewSet (create for players, list/review/update for staff, filters)
- ✅ Staff inbox integration (GM applications appear as triage category)
- ✅ Trust/feedback — reuses existing `PlayerTrust.gm_trust_level` from stories app
- Permission checks deferred to individual commands (each checks `GMProfile.level` as needed)

### Phase 2 — GM Tables ✅
- ✅ `GMTable` model (gm FK, name, status, lifecycle fields, archived_at)
- ✅ `GMTableMembership` (persona-pinned, soft-leave, unique-active-constraint, temporary-persona rejection)
- ✅ Service functions (create, archive, transfer_ownership, join, leave, retire-persona hook)
- ✅ ViewSets with staff/GM permission split and staff-only actions (archive, transfer_ownership)
- ✅ `last_active_at` stub on GMProfile (not yet auto-stamped)
- Remaining: story attachment (future phase when stories are wired up), frontend pages (Phase 5)

### Phase 3 — Roster & Recruitment ✅
- ✅ `Story.primary_table` FK links stories to tables (orphaned stories are legal, character falls out of default visibility)
- ✅ `CharacterDraft` extended with `is_gm_creation`, `target_table`, `story_title`, `story_description`
- ✅ `finalize_gm_character` service creates character + story + participation atomically; character goes to Available roster with no tenure
- ✅ Shared finalize helpers extracted from `finalize_character` for reuse
- ✅ `RosterEntry.objects.actively_overseen()` queryset filters for characters with active stories at active GM tables
- ✅ `gm_application_queue` service surfaces pending apps to the overseeing GM
- ✅ `approve_application_as_gm` / `deny_application_as_gm` — GM-side approval that verifies table ownership; delegates to existing `RosterApplication` flow so tenure creation + side effects stay intact
- ✅ `surrender_character_story` — GM releases a story, clearing `primary_table`
- ✅ `GMRosterInvite` model (single-use, 30-day default expiry, public or private with email match)
- ✅ Invite services: `create_invite`, `revoke_invite`, `claim_invite` with `select_for_update` for race safety
- ✅ API: `GMRosterInviteViewSet`, `GMApplicationQueueView`, `GMApplicationActionView`, `GMInviteClaimView`
- ✅ Staff continue to see applications via existing staff inbox; GM queue surfaces the same apps to the overseeing GM
- Remaining: frontend (Phase 5), email delivery for private invites (follow-up), level-gated character creation exceptions (kudo points / GM leeway — post-MVP)

### Phase 4 — Reward Tooling (cut — moved to Stories)
Rewards are not a GM concern. GMs are storytellers and umpires, not
paymasters. Story beats resolve into automatic rewards/consequences based
on success conditions. GMs describe outcomes but do not decide them.
Things that belong to Stories instead:
- Story risk/stakes tiers gating reward magnitude
- Automatic reward dispatch when a beat resolves
- Anti-abuse via story-level caps, not per-GM quotas
- Audit trail via story beat history

Potential GM-specific tooling that may warrant a future phase:
- Umpire check-modifier tooling (GM applies `+2 difficulty` or
  `+2 advantage` to an in-progress check based on RP context)
- This is GM *shaping* outcomes without *deciding* them

### Phase 5 — Dashboards and UI (deferred until after Stories)
The GM dashboard is story-shaped, not roster-shaped. What GMs actually
need to see day-to-day:
- Their tables, with upcoming planned sessions for each
- Stories at each table, with their current beat/chapter state
- Encounters, challenges, NPCs mapped to upcoming sessions
- A calendar for session scheduling + player coordination
- Q/A with individual players (story clarifications, character
  development questions, etc.)
- Roster application review is infrequent — it's the blue-moon task,
  not the daily one

Building this frontend before Stories exists would mean throwing it
away. Deferring until after Stories is in place so the dashboard
reflects real GM workflow.

Day-to-day GM ops that the staff inbox + existing APIs cover for now:
- Application queue (staff / admin can action; GMs will get the
  dedicated view post-Stories)
- Invite generation (can be done via admin / API until dashboard lands)

## Cross-System Dependencies

- **Stories app** — needs GM role relations and permission checks added as it grows
- **Roster app** — RosterApplication stays as-is but shows up in the staff inbox; GMs eventually get scoped approval permissions via delegation tiers
- **Scenes app** — GMCharacter needs to participate in scenes (likely works out of the box)
- **Combat app** — GM combat tools build on Phase 3's GM-gated encounter management
- **Trust system** — current stub needs fleshing out with the upvote mechanics; late design

## Notes

The GM system is safety-critical. Players need a reliable path to report problematic behavior before we open up new trust relationships (GMs have power over other players, so the stakes go up). The Staff Inbox & Player Submissions infrastructure must exist before GM onboarding — we do not want to grant players GM powers without the reporting system already in place.

Note that the full PlayerReport UX (form wording, flow, block/mute integration) is a separate design pass, deferred until we have the right context to design it delicately. The first PR establishes the data model and basic submission path.

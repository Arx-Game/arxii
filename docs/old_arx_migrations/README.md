# Porting Systems from Arx I

These notes outline how Arx II will draw inspiration from the first game while moving to a fully data driven architecture. We are not importing character data or recipes. Instead we plan to capture the feel of key systems and improve on them with modern tooling.

Reference documents:

- `scenes.md` – Player run scenes and trust based GM tools
- `crafting.md` – Rebuilding the crafting process
- `combat.md` – Designing cooperative combat encounters
- `traits.md` – Handling advantages and backgrounds
- `progression.md` – Account XP and development based advancement

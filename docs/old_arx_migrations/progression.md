# Progression

Arx II introduces a two tier advancement system. Accounts earn experience points (XP) that can unlock new character slots or major abilities. Individual characters progress through many smaller "development" tracks such as skills, relationships and magic affinities.

Development points accrue when a character spends time training or interacting with relevant systems. XP gates major milestones like new classes or broad power tiers. This encourages players to invest effort across multiple areas while still rewarding narrative achievements.

The game will be class and level based, unlike Arx I. Levels measure overall capability but development points let characters specialize in nearly any aspect of play.

# Traits

Traits in Arx II cover advantages, backgrounds and other character defining choices. We will not import any existing trait values, but we want players to recognize the same themes.

Plans:

- New models describe each trait's costs and prerequisites.
- Generic utilities replace the scattered checks used in Arx I and apply changes consistently.
- Development occurs over time and can trigger rewards or side effects when progress is recorded.

The system should feel flexible and allow new trait categories to be added without code changes.

# Scenes

Arx I used a system called "RPEvents" for player run story scenes. To avoid clashing with the engine's own event hooks we refer to them as **scenes** in Arx II. No scene logs or data need to be imported from the original game. We only care about matching the flexibility that players enjoyed.

Scenes serve purely as an organizational space for roleplay. They track participants and logs in the database. Scenes are mostly driven by commands, with a story framework providing guardrails and guidance for GMs. Player GMs gain autonomy over time through a trust or level system. At higher trust levels they can run stories with the same authority that staff wielded in Arx I, but without needing access to administrative commands.

Key goals:

- Scenes are launched and managed via commands.
- Trust levels gate the scope of actions a player GM may take during a scene.
- GM commands cover administrative needs so storytelling flows smoothly.
